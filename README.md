Project: Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Description:
This repository contains the code and resources related to a machine learning project focused on image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project aims to classify images from the CIFAR10 dataset into 10 different categories.

Key Features:

Data Exploration: Analysis of the CIFAR10 dataset, including shape, distribution, and visualization of sample images.
Data Preprocessing: Normalization of pixel values to improve model performance.
Model Building: Construction of a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a more complex Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.
Model Training: Training both models on the CIFAR10 dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy and classification report.
